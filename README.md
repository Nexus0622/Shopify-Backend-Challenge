# Shopify-Backend-Challenge
Nathan Kofoed 5/22/2022

Simple application created for the fall 2022 Shopify Backend Internship Challenge

This project is pretty simple, as I was made aware of this oppurtunity late in the application time window. You can create, update
and delete inventory items, and then when viewing an item you can update it or add it to a warehouse. You can also view a list of
warehouses, as well as a list of the content of each warehouse, where you can remove items from the warehouse
